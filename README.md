This is a simple repository experiments with the hexagonal binning algorithm.
 
First, there is an implementation of the hexagonal binning algorithm in python (see `hexbin.binner.py`).

Additionally, there is a simple Google Maps demo that uses the output from the binning algorithm and plots
the hexagons on a map.

See `web/js/hex-overlay.js` for the custom map overlay that does the plotting.
